# Google Scholar Profile Analyzer

This repository is dedicated to analyzing profiles from Google Scholar using web scraping techniques. The project is structured into four main folders: `extract`, `transform`, `load`, and `analysis`. Each folder serves a specific purpose in the data extraction and analysis pipeline.

## Project Structure

### 1. Extract

The `extract` folder contains all the methods and scripts used for extracting data from Google Scholar profiles. This involves web scraping to gather information such as publications, citations, and other relevant details.

### 2. Transform

In the `transform` folder, you will find functions and scripts for transforming the raw data extracted from Google Scholar. This step may include cleaning, formatting, and structuring the data into a more usable and standardized format.

### 3. Load

The `load` folder is dedicated to storing the final extracted and transformed data. This is the endpoint of the data pipeline, where the information is saved in a format suitable for further analysis.

### 4. Analysis

The `analysis` folder contains scripts and notebooks for performing various analyses on the loaded data. This may involve generating visualizations, statistical analyses, or any other methods to derive insights from the Google Scholar profiles.
